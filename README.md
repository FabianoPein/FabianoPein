### Hi there :v:
My name is Fabiano Pein, I worked for many years in quality system management, but due to my strong interest in information technology, I decided to make this area migration. I currently work with IT support at T-Systems do Brasil, where I support German customers on their systems, in German and English.
<br>
I'm a Front End Programmer, where I'm learning and creating projects in HTML and CSS, and also developing myself in JavaScript and React.
